# Ryanne Napoleon's SQL Portfolio

Welcome! Within this repository, you will find a collection of SQL examples I have developed for personal projects and while studying SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. I have highlighted a few projects below, including data visualizations created using Tableau. Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback or questions.

[Fruit Imports](https://github.com/RyanneTech/SQL/blob/main/Fruit%20Imports) | In this project, I created my own data to analyze fruits that have been imported through the four seasons and some that were imported year round. I used the case expression to determine which fruits had either a full, sufficient or low supply. Additionally, I used the case expression to calculate the total cost for each season.

[Student Loans](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryanne.napoleon/viz/StudentLoans_16867176149500/StudentLoans)| This dashboard aims to provide the audience with a comprehensive analysis of student loans in each state, focusing on the average student loans per recipient. By exploring the dashboard, users can gain contextual understanding and compare states to identify which one has the highest average student loans. Additionally, the dashboard offers options to view loan types, school types, and narrow down the analysis to specific regions.
[Stock Performance Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryanne.napoleon/viz/StockPerformanceDashboard_16845484880370/StockPerformanceDashboard2) | My stock performance dashboard is designed to offer users a comprehensive overview of the performance of various stocks within my portfolio. It provides real-time data on the value of each individual position for a specific stock, as well as the overall change in the value of my portfolio.
