# Ryanne Napoleon's SQL Portfolio

Welcome! Within this repository, you will find a collection of SQL examples I have developed for personal projects and while studying SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. I have highlighted a few projects below, including data visualizations created using Tableau. Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback or questions.
