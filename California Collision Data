---For each day of the year in 2009, how many bicyclists were severly injured or complained 
about pain after being a victim in a accident at dawn and dawn?---

WHERE collision_date BETWEEN ('2009-01-01') AND ('2009-12-31')
AND victim_role IN ('bicyclist')
AND lighting IN ('dusk or dawn')
AND victim_degree_of_injury IN ('complaint of pain', 'severe injury')
